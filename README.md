# Overview

This is an educational project demonstrating implementation of data structure and algorithms.

Please install the following items to work with the working examples.

* Go version 1.18 or later

## Project structure

The working examples in this project are executable within docker containers or network of containers.

You will find the Go codes used to build applications in these folders:

* `build` -- scripts used to create apps and containers
* `cmd` -- source codes for building executables
* `internal` - share packages to for `cmd`
â€¢ `scripts` - bash scripts to help you build and execute apps.

## Working examples

You will find detail descriptions of applications and data models in this project.

### Applications

* [BIFID cipher](./docs/bifid.md)
* [Palindrom detector](./cmd/palindrome/) is an application that detects a word or number that reads the same forward or backward. The application includes two ways of determining if a word is a palindrome. The two approaches are benchmarked.

### Data models

* [Table models](./docs/table.md)
* [Tree structures](./docs/treemdl.md)
* [Roman numerals](./docs/romans.md)

## Disclaimers

* The packages in this project are intended for educational purpose only.
