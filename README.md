# Overview

This is an educational project demonstrating implementation of data structure and algorithms.

## cmd

This folder contains a collection of main packages used to create executable apps.

## internal

This folder contains shared dependency packages to support development work under `cmd` folder.

## Docs

You will find detail descriptions of applications and data models in this project.

### Applications

* [BIFID cipher](./docs/bifid.md)
* [Palindrom detector](./cmd/palindrome/) is an application that detects a word or number that reads the same forward or backward. The application includes two ways of determining if a word is a palindrome. The two approaches are benchmarked.

### Data models

* [Table models](./docs/table.md)
* [Tree structures](./docs/treemdl.md)
* [Roman numerals](./docs/romans.md)

## Disclaimers

* The packages in this module are intended for educational purpose only.
* The implementation in this module are mostly based on Go 1.18
