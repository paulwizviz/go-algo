* [Palindrom detector](./cmd/palindrome/) is an application that detects a word or number that reads the same forward or backward. The application includes two ways of determining if a word is a palindrome. The two approaches are benchmarked.

### Data models

* [Table models](./docs/table.md)
* [Tree structures](./docs/treemdl.md)
* [Roman numerals](./docs/romans.md)
